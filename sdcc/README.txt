  Derivation
  ==========

This project is beyond my graduate design,the main purpose is that I'm willing port PWM communication projects based on Keil to SDCC,the platform is C8051F410.


  Usage
  =====

Now there are two different versions of this project,one is for Keil and another is for SDCC and I will concentrate my attention to SDCC trunk.


  Requisition
  ===========

In order to build from source files(now onl svn available),you will need some common tools:

- unix shell tools(msys,cygwin,GNUwin32) needed by makefile for SDCC
- doxygen and graphviz to generate documentation.
